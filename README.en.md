## Review

This application allows the user to plan tasks and track their progress.

The application functionality allows you to create a nested structure:

- Work direction;
- Subdirections;
- Task cards by subdirections.
- All these elements can be edited and deleted.

The functionality of the cards allows you to change:

- Name;
- Description;
- Priority;
- End date for task completion;
- Moving to another subdirection.

If the task must be completed today, a colored bell appears on the card.

### We are confident that the application will be liked by the user and will be useful to him.
